# Front-End Internship case study:

We would like to put together a small interface where a user can login and go through a catalogue of products each having a picture, a title and a preview of its description. And when an item is clicked a pop up should be displayed with all the elements visible and scrollable if need be.
The interface should be paginated (5 elements per page for example).

This image should serve you as inspiration but is no way a mandatory design.
Basing yourself on a JS framework(React/Vue/Next...) Develop the described interface using up to standards coding techniques and be ready to defend your design ideas and code choices & implementation.
